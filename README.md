## Angular Exercise - DAV Admin

Create a repo in your personal Github to use for this exercise… 

1) Create a new Angular project using the CLI: https://angular.dev/tools/cli

2) Use the default component (AppComponent) generated by the CLI to display a table of all Jobs from this endpoint:  https://qa.coast.noaa.gov/dav/api/v1/admin/dashboard/jobs
Important that you use async pipe to hydrate the table!

3) Add a reactive form to the component that has 1 form control: requestId

4) Add a validator to the requestId form control so that only numeric values are allowed. Display a validation message in the template when the validation fails.

5) To the Observable that hydrates the table, add filtering functionality that searches the Jobs for the requestId provided in the form control (as the user types). The filtering will be done client-side, as opposed to searching via the API.

  Hint: A reactive form exposes an Observable called valueChanges() that you can use to combineLatest (another hint!) with the Jobs Observable to filter the results.

6) Extra points! Create a pipe that highlights the requestID if it’s found in the results.
